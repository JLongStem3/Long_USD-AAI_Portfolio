# USD-AAI_Portfolio

Welcome, this repository is a collection of projects that I have collected throughout my experience as a Master's Student at the University of San Diego enrolled in their Applied Artificial Intelligence program. I am new to GitHub, with a Bachelors in Physics and prior experience with traditional life-science and engineering. I am passionate about applying my scientific knowledge to build impactful and applicable real-world solutions. My top interest right now is in using computer vision to research brain imaging data, driven by my understanding of brain trauma and past experience as a former student-athlete. I am still open to exploring different areas of research.

**[(1) AI Fundamentals & Applications](https://github.com/JLongStem3/Long_USD-AAI_Portfolio/tree/main/AI%20Fundamentals%20%26%20Application%20-%20Prediction%20Model)**  
This project explores the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence (AI) by comparing two machine learning algorithms, Random Forest and XGBoost, for predictive analysis using the [Heart Disease Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishidamarla/heart-disease-prediction) dataset. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) reveals key trends, such as a strong correlations and highlights imbalances that may introduce bias. This project emphasizes machine learning development and real-world applications.

**[(2) Computer Vision (Exercise) - Object Detection](https://github.com/JLongStem3/Long_USD-AAI_Portfolio/tree/main/Computer%20Vision%20(Exercise)%20-%20Object%20Detection)**  
Introducing key computer vision methodologies through a three-part assignment involving video processing, pose estimation, and real-time object detection. OpenCV is used to read a video, extract metadata, and apply filters to create a sketch effect. _Pose estimation_ using TensorFlow Hub to analyze movements in a GIF format video. Real-time object detection with YOLOv8 and a webcam integrates pre-trained models for live camera feed capture. Note you must provide your own video files (video/path) to use the code effectively. This project mphasizes hands-on learning with tools like Google Colab, OpenCV, and TensorFlow, progressively building skills in video analysis and AI-based detection techniques.

**[(3) Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/JLongStem3/Long_USD-AAI_Portfolio/tree/main/Natural%20Language%20Processing)**  
In this study we build a chatbot by leveraging the [Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/ubuntu-dialogue-corpus), a vast dataset containing nearly one million dialogues from Ubuntu support chats. We train a chatbot on a focused subset of dialogueText_196 we used for processing. We used a pretrained transformer-based GPT architecture. Once trained, the chatbot was integrated into a user-friendly interface. Responses are displayed within the notebook for easy tests and continuing research. The project demonstrates how naturally occurring dialogue data can enhance a chatbotâ€™s ability to engage users effectively.
